	TEXT   CHARACTER = 2 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2015 char 2^nNumerous lobopodians have been considered to have cephalic sclerites (see ref. 65, character 37), but in some cases this interpretation requires revision or confirmation through new material. Following recent data presented by Liu and Dunlop (66), this character is scored absent in Hallucigenia fortis (contra ref. 67), Onychodictyon ferox (contra ref. 39) and Cardiodictyon (see ref. 67). An uncertain scoring is used where the anterior region is ambiguously preserved, such as in H. hongmeia (68). This character is scored as present in for the sclerotized structures observed in the head region of Luolishania (5) and the Emu Bay Shale Collins’ monster (ref. 3, fig. 1c), as the morphological similarity with Collinsium strengthens the likelihood that the cephalic sclerites represent a legitimate feature in the former taxon (contra ref. 3). Collinsium bears a pair of discrete subrectangular sclerites on the anterior region (Fig. 1). Taxa with an incomplete anterior region (e.g. Acinocricus, Hadranax, Orstenotubulus) are coded as uncertain. This character is coded as uncertain for the Burgess Shale Collins’ monster (2) as the only photograph of this taxon does not allow the presence of head sclerites to be distinguished.';

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 3 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2015 ch 3^nScored as (–) inapplicable if: head sclerites (Character 2) absent^nThis character is scored as absent for fuxianhuiids, because the cephalic shield is not derived from fused segments (1. 53, 56, 69), and in radiodontans, because the carapace-like structure on the head seems not to cover multiple cephalic segments (20, 70, 71, 72). This character is scored as absent in the Emu Bay Shale Collins’ monster based on the close morphological similarities with the anterior organization in Luolishania (5, 73) and Collinsium (Fig. 1).';

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 4 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2015 ch 4^nScored as (–) inapplicable if: head sclerites (Character 2) are absent^nThis character is scored as present in radiodontans because the dorsal carapace-like structure covering their heads is associated with eye-stalks, regardless of its shape or size (e.g. 20, 71, 72). Anterior sclerites are widespread among Paleozoic euarthropods including fuxianhuiids (1, 61), and artiopodans (57, 60). Recent palaeoneurological data support the homology of the dorsal carapace-like plate in Radiodonta with the anterior sclerite of upper-stem and crown-group Euarthropoda (74). This character is scored as absent in Collinsium and Luolishania (5) given that the isolated sclerites on the head region are not associated with stalked lateral eyes; an uncertain score is coded for the Emu Bay Shale Collins’ monster as it is not possible to discern the anterior organization of the only available specimen, despite the presence of a well-defined isolated sclerite (3).';

Although Liu et al. (76) described the appendages of the lobopodian Diania as having an arthropodized organization, a recent revision of this taxon by Ma et al. (65) concluded that the podomere-like structures on the legs are the result of taphonomic artifacts during burial; Diania is thus scored as having lobopodous appendages.';

This character is scored as proboscis (putatively fused protocerebral appendages) for Opabinia and KUMIP 314087.

(21, 80) recently described the radiodontan Aegirocassis benmoulae, which indicates that some representatives of this group possess two sets of lateral flaps that are homologous to the outer and inner branches of the appendages in euarthropods, and thus represent a derived state relative to the presence of cylindrical ambulatory legs. This character is scored for most radiodontans following the data presented by Van Roy et al. (21, 80, rectified from ref. 16); an uncertain score is coded for Schinderhannes given the uncertainty regarding the morphological interpretation of this taxon (19, 70), and for KUMIP 314087.';

Schinderhannes is scored as having a lobopodous ambulatory limb based on the structure of the enlarged body flap, which is the first observable post-ocular appendage pair (19). Antennacanthopodia is scored as having a lobopodous sensorial limb based on the morphology of the deutocerebral “second antennae” (82). A lobopodous sensorial limb is also scored for the corresponding deutocerebral appendages in Hallucigenia sparsa (83) and H. fortis (84), as they are more slender than the more posterior walking legs.^nThis character is scored for as present for the deutocerebral chelicerae of Limulus (2, 37) under the proposed evolutionary transition from the short-great appendages of megacheirans into the first appendage of crown-group Chelicerata (9).^nStage 5 added to describe the condition in Sinoburius (Chen et al. 2019)';

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 19 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2015 ch 14^nScored as (–) inapplicable if: paired appendages (ch 1) absent^nThere are various taxa in which the deutocerebral appendage pair is morphologically differentiated from the rest of the trunk appendages (see references in ref. 66). For example, Antennacanthopodia has a second set of antenna-like limbs that are morphologically distinct from the walking legs (82). Although the deutocerebral appendage in Collinsium and other Luolishaniidae is morphologically specialized (2–5), this is expressed on the anterior five or six legs; consequently, this character is scored as absent given that the deutocerebral limb pair is not uniquely differentiated relative to other trunk appendages. Daley and Edgecombe (71) redescribed Anomalocaris canadensis and reported the presence of a smaller set of flaps in proximity with the putative head region; given that this differentiation is expressed in size, rather than structural identity, the deutocerebral limbs are scored as undifferentiated in Anomalocaris. This character is scored as uncertain for Schinderhannes (21) as the preservation does not allow identifying the occurrence of limbs on the anterior region. The first pair of legs in Tardigrada is serially homologous with the deutocerebral segment of Euarthropoda (35), and thus is not structurally different from the rest of the trunk appendages. The deutocerebral jaws of Onychophora are significantly modified relative to the rest of the appendages in the body (25, 32). In Euarthropoda, this morphological differentiation is generally expressed in the presence of an antenniform (1, 57, 62) or raptorial (52, 55, 63) deutocerebral appendage. Tertiapatus is scored as uncertain as the preservation does not allow observing the presence of possible jaws as in extant onychophorans (18, 81).';

Tertiapatus is scored as possessing paired oral papillae (18). Schinderhannes is coded as lobopodous based on the presence of the hypertrophied body flap appendage pair, suggesting that other trunk appendages had a similar nonarthropodized construction as observed in the similarly organized Lyrarapax (20). This character is scored as uncertain in Hadranax (85), Orstenotubulus (86) and Hallucigenia hongmeia (68), as it is not possible to observe the structure of the second post-ocular appendage pair in the available material.^nState 4 is introduced to reflect the appendicular morphology of the notostracan Triops (3, 26, 39).^n^n**may need to update state 4 if Ercaicunia included as it is uniramous, and coded state 2 for Sinoburius but it is more antenniform than walking.

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 21 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2015 ch 16^nScored as (–) inapplicable if: paired appendages (ch 1) absent^nThis character is scored as ventral in Euarthropoda given that the reduced protocerebral appendage pair, transformed into the labrum, occupies a ventral position in association with the mouth (44). The forward-facing stylet apparatus of Eutardigrada is internalized into the mouth cone (37), and is thus considered as having a terminal position relative to the body; in Heterotardigrada, however, the mouth is orientated ventrally, and thus the stylet apparatus is also scored as having a ventral orientation. The antennae-like limbs on the head region of Collinsium and Luolishania (5) are scored as having a lateral position.

The stylet apparatus of Tardigrada is not coded as fused, as each stylet within the buccal tube remains independent despite significant modification (37, 88,  89).

When compressed in perfect lateral view the endites appear straight(although the distal ends are deformed by compressionor project into the matrix; e.g. Figs 2A, 3H), but in oblique view they may appear to bend forward or backward to varying degrees, depending on the exact angle of burial.

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 118 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2016 ch 88^nScored as (−) inapplicable if: VNC unpaired (character 119). ^nMedian interpedal commissures are conspicuous in the ladderlike VNC of Onychophora (12, 13, 16, 29, 38) (Fig. S5A). Recently, Mayer et al. (16) described in detail the presence of transverse interpedal median commissures that fall outside of the condensed ganglia in the nerve cord of Eutardigrada (Fig. S5B), suggesting that this represents a plesiomorphic condition reminiscent of the possibly orthogonal organization hypothesized for an ancestral panarthropod. Schulze and Schmidt-Rhaesa (42) and Schulze et al. (28) have reported similar nonganglion associated commisures in the Heterotardigrada, indicating that this represents a widespread condition within Tardigrada. The VNC of Euarthropoda lacks signs of interpedal commissures (1, 2, 16, 37, 46) (Fig. S5 C and D); this character is scored as absent for Alalcomenaeus sp. (9) and scored as uncertain in Lyrarapax (10) and C. kunmingensis (23 and Yang et al. 2016), as it is not possible to resolve the preservation of interpedal commissures in the available material.';

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 119 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2016 ch 89^nThe nerve cord of Priapulida (4, 31) and Onychophora (12, 13, 15, 16) displays a typical orthogonal organization, consisting of several ring-like commissures and peripheral nerves that intersect with additional dorsal and lateral longitudinal nerve strands, forming a distinctive net-like pattern. The nervous system of Tardigrada also displays dorsal and lateral longitudinal nerves that are intersected by transverse peripheral nerves (16, 18, 38, 43), although these organisms lack complete ring commissures (see character 124). Schulze and Schmidt-Rhaesa (28) reported loop-like neurites that extend dorsally in E. testudo; this organization is similar to that observed in eutardigrades (16), and thus this character is scored as present. However, an orthogonallike organization has not been resolved in the heterotardigrades B. pennaki and A. doryphorus (28); pending additional data, this character is scored as uncertain as it is unknown whether this absence of legitimate or whether this aspect of the morphology has not been resolved due to differences in specimen fixation and/or ontogeny (41, p. 51). Although the presence of peripheral nerves (see character 127) throughout the VNC of C. kunmingensis may suggest the presence of an orthogon-like organization, as expressed in Onychophora, this character is conservatively scored as uncertain due to the lack of distal preservation of the nerve roots.';

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 120 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2016 ch 90^nScored as inapplicable if: VNC organization is not orthogonal (Character 123)^nThis character distinguishes the complete ring commissures of Priapulida and Onychophora (12, 13, 15, 31) from the incomplete peripheral commissures that emerge from the condensed ganglia in the nerve cord of some tardigrades (16, 18, 42). This character is scored as uncertain for C. kunmingensis given the incomplete distal preservation of the peripheral nerves (character 127).';

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 121 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2016 ch 91^nScored as inapplicable if: paired appendages absent (ch 1)^nThe leg nerves emerging from the condensed ganglia in the VNC in Tardigrada and Euarthropoda evince an organization that reflects the position of the parasegmental boundaries in these organisms, resulting in an anterior displacement relative to the actual position of the trunk appendages (16, 28, 42). By contrast, neuronal tracing indicates that this anterior displacement is not expressed in Onychophora (16). Although the orientation of the peripheral nerves in the ganglia of C. kunmingensis could potentially suggest the anterior displacement of the leg nerves relative to the appendages in fuxianhuiids, this character is conservatively scored as uncertain as it is not possible to confirm this condition given the lack of distal preservation of the nerve roots.';

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 122 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2016 ch 92^nScored as inapplicable if: paired appendages absent (ch 1)^nThis character describes the condition observed in onychophorans and tardigrades, in which each leg is innervated by two nerves (12, 13, 16, 18, 28, 42, 45); by contrast, a single nerve innervates each leg in Euarthropoda. This character is scored as uncertain for C. kunmingensis as the incomplete preservation of the nerves in the VNC does not allow resolving their precise relationship with the leg innervation.';

	TEXT   CHARACTER = 123 TEXT = 'Yang et al. 2016 ch 93^nRegularly spaced peripheral nerves are characteristic of the orthogonal nervous system of Priapulida (31) and Onychophora (see “interpedal nerves” in refs. 12, 13, 15, and 16) (Fig. S5A). Although the VNC of some crown-group euarthropods displays the so-called intersegmental nerves outside of the segmented ganglia (Fig. S5 C and D), this character is scored as absent as these nerves do not occur regularly throughout the entire length of the corresponding connectives (1, 4, 5, 7, 37, 47). Intersegmental peripheral nerves are entirely absent in Tardigrada (16, 28) (Fig. S5B). The exceptional preservation in C. kunmingensis demonstrates the persistence of segmental and intersegmental peripheral nerves throughout the length of the VNC in representatives of upper stem-group Euarthropoda (Figs. 1 and 2 and Fig. S1).';

(19)], and hypothesized as a potential synapomorphy of Tardigrada and Euarthropoda. However, neurological studies of Heterotardigrada have been unable to find evidence for the presence of the stomatogastric ganglion (28, 42); this character is scored as uncertain for Heterotardigrada pending the input of additional neurological data.
